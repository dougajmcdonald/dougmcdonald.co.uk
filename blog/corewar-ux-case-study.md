Working remotely has many benefits, this is a comparison of my remote vs office day

<!-- end -->

I am fortunate enough that [BMT](https://bmt.org) offers a comprehensive smart working policy which include remote working. I regularly work from home on a Tuesday and this is why it benefits me.

## My remote schedule

05:30 - Get woken up by my daughter (Phoebe), bring her into the bed and go back to sleep
06:00 - Realise I'm not going back to sleep and spend an hour listening to Phoebe babbling getting poked in the eye
07:30 - Get up and make my wife (Kim) a coffee, clean teeth, skip the shower
08:00 - Login to my work laptop and spend a few minutes reviewing the previous day, capturing to-do tasks and planning the day, begin work
10:15 - Try to comb bed hair, dial into Skype standup hope no-one notices the lack of shower. A bonus is that our development takes responsibility for setting up their end we identify connectivity issues
10:30 - Finish stand up, make coffee and possibly posh breakfast like a bacon sarnie, feel guilt free as I know I'm going to focus for the rest of the day
Lunch - Anytime between 12:00-14:00 - Take Phoebe so Kim can go out for half an hour. Play with Phoebe whilst making a sandwich. Perhaps read a book for 15 minutes. Take 30-60 minutes.
After Lunch - Work uninterrupted for 3-5 hours depending on the day.
17:00 - Finish, no commute, give Phoebe her dinner and get her ready for bed.

## My office schedule

05:30 - Get woken up by my daughter (Phoebe), bring her into the bed and go back to sleep
06:00 - Realise I'm not going back to sleep and spend an hour trying to rest enough for the day in the office
06:30 - Get up and make my wife (Kim) a coffee, clean teeth, take a shower
07:00 - Leave the house, 30 minute commute, 15 minute walk
08:00 - Arrive in the office and spend a few minutes reviewing the previous day, capturing to-do tasks and planning the day, begin work
08:10 - Try to easy porridge at desk, inevitably get interrupted, feel guilty at eating during working hours
10:15 - Dial others into Skype standup hope remote workers remembered
10:30 - Finish stand up, make coffee pop outside for a vape, rush back
Lunch - Anytime between 12:00-14:00 - Walk to supermarket, buy bread role, make sandwich, eat at desk, browse BBC sport for 5 minutes, back to work.
After Lunch - Work for 3-5 hours depending on the day, perhaps go 30 minutes without interruption
17:00 - Finish, walk up hill
17:15 - Get to car
18:00 - Get home, might be in time to give Phoebe a bath, might not
